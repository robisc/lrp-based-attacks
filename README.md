# lrp-based-attacks

In this repo, I document the results of my Master Thesis about adversarial attacks that are based on explainable AI methods, more precisely here: Layerwise Relevance Propagation (https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai/technologies-and-solutions/layer-wise-relevance-propagation.html).
This repo is still under work, more documentation will follow
