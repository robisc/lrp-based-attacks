# lrp-based-attacks

In this repo, I document the results of my Master Thesis about adversarial attacks that are based on explainable AI methods, more precisely here: Layerwise Relevance Propagation (https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai/technologies-and-solutions/layer-wise-relevance-propagation.html).

## More about this implementation

The implementation is based on tensorflow for now, however I plan to extent it to pytorch
Libraries used:
- python      3.10.8
- numpy       1.21.5
- pandas      1.5.1
- tensorflow   2.10.0

Most information can be found in the uploaded pdf of my master thesis or the repo. However please consider this figure for choosing the LRP-process
